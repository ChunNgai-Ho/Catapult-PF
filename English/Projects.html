    <img src="/imgaes/HongKongHB.jpg" alt="Hong Kong Harbor">
  </div>
  <div class="text">
    <p>This is the Victoria Harbour in Hong Kong. I created this art piece for the Congressional Art Competition for High School Students. A sad story behind it is that I got pneumonia while working on it, so I never had the chance to finish it. It's still lacking details and doesn’t have proper shading yet, but I would love to complete it once I return to school. </p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Row 2 -->
<div class="row">
  <div class="text">
    <p>In this piece of art, I was inspired by Junji Ito, I am his big fan, so I really wanted to create an art pieace that is similar to his style. I read such works as Tomie painting and examined his use of shading, contrast, and creepy facial expressions to produce a creepy effect. </p>

  <div class="arts-3">
    <img src="/imgaes/Society.jpg" alt="Society">
  </div>
  <div class="text">
    <p>The name of this art piece is “Society” because I wanted to capture the unsettling feeling of being constantly watched. The figures are dressed nicely in suits to represent how people often appear polite on the outside. Their white heads symbolize emptiness or hidden intentions, while the red eyes represent danger, judgment, and pressure—like they’re silently hoping you’ll fail. It reflects the quiet yet intense anxiety that comes from societal expectations and scrutiny.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Row 4 -->
<div class="row">
  <div class="text">In this linoleum printing art work, the concept of fear prompted me to come up with a spider like character with human eyes and faces. I selected a spider since it is something that most people fear. The faces and eyes demonstrate the sense of being observed.
