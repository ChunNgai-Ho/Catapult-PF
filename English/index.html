      <div class="details">At 12, I watched some YouTube videos and took some online lessons on C++, which built a basic foundation in computer science, but I never got the chance to learn it again or apply it. Now, in 2025, I am an intern in the Nextech Catapult Program, which has taught me HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm planning to master these languages and then attempt to learn Python in the future.</div>
